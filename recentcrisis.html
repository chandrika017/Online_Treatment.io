<h1>CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19)</h1>
<p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment.Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).[10] It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has resulted in an ongoing pandemic. As of 25 September 2020, more than 32.3 million cases have been reported across 188 countries and territories with more than 984,000 deaths; more than 22.2 million people have recovered.[9]

Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath or breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste.[7] While most people have mild symptoms, some people develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) possibly precipitated by cytokine storm,[11] multi-organ failure, septic shock, and blood clots. The incubation period may range from one to fourteen days.[12]</p>
<h1>HOW IT SPREADS</h1>
<p>The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces.
You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within close proximity of someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth.The disease spreads between people most often when they are physically close.[a] It spreads very easily and sustainably through the air, primarily via small droplets or particles such as aerosols, produced after an infected person breathes, coughs, sneezes, talks or sings.[13][14] It may also be transmitted via contaminated surfaces, although this has not been conclusively demonstrated.[14][15][16] It can spread for up to two days prior to symptom onset, and from people who are asymptomatic.[14] People remain infectious for 7â€“12 days in moderate cases, and up to two weeks in severe cases.[14][12] The standard method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab. Chest CT imaging may also be helpful for diagnosis in individuals where there is a high suspicion of infection based on symptoms and risk factors, however guidelines do not recommend using it for routine screening.

Recommended measures to prevent infection include frequent hand washing, social distancing, quarantine, covering coughs along with sneezes, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face.[8] The use of cloth face coverings such as a scarf or a bandana has been recommended by health officials in public settings to minimise the risk of transmissions, with some authorities requiring their use. Health officials also stated that medical-grade face masks, such as N95 masks, should be used only by healthcare workers, first responders, and those who directly care for infected individuals.</p>

<h1>Dengue fever</h1>
<p>Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne tropical disease caused by the dengue virus.[1] Symptoms typically begin three to fourteen days after infection.[2] These may include a high fever, headache, vomiting, muscle and joint pains, and a characteristic skin rash.[1][2] Recovery generally takes two to seven days.[1] In a small proportion of cases, the disease develops into severe dengue, also known as dengue hemorrhagic fever, resulting in bleeding, low levels of blood platelets and blood plasma leakage, or into dengue shock syndrome, where dangerously low blood pressure occurs.[1][2]

Dengue is spread by several species of female mosquitoes of the Aedes genus, principally Aedes aegypti.[1][2] The virus has five serotypes;[7][8] infection with one type usually gives lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term immunity to the others.[1] Subsequent infection with a different type increases the risk of severe complications.[1] A number of tests are available to confirm the diagnosis including detecting antibodies to the virus or its RNA.[2]</p>
<h1>Signs and symptoms</h1>
<p>Typically, people infected with dengue virus are asymptomatic (80%) or have only mild symptoms such as an uncomplicated fever.[20][21][22] Others have more severe illness (5%), and in a small proportion it is life-threatening.[20][22] The incubation period (time between exposure and onset of symptoms) ranges from 3 to 14 days, but most often it is 4 to 7 days.[23] Therefore, travelers returning from endemic areas are unlikely to have dengue fever if symptoms start more than 14 days after arriving home.[13] Children often experience symptoms similar to those of the common cold and gastroenteritis (vomiting and diarrhea)[24] and have a greater risk of severe complications,[13][25] though initial symptoms are generally mild but include high fever.[25]</p>
